# Todo List Application

A simple Todo List application built with React, allowing users to manage tasks by adding, editing, deleting, and marking them as complete. Tasks are persisted in the browser's local storage.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the list.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete. [IN FUTURE UPDATE]
- Persist tasks in local storage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list-app.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd todo-list-app
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:
```sh
npm start
```

## Usage
- Open the application in your browser.
- Add a new task using the input field and the "Add" button.
- Edit a task by clicking the edit icon next to it.
- Delete a task by clicking the trash icon next to it.
